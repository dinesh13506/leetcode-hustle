### 179. Largest Number
[179. Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)

Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

```
Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
```

```
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

Constraints:

1. 1 <= nums.length <= 100
2. 0 <= nums[i] <= 109
