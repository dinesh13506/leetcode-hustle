### 287. Find the Duplicate Number
[287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

1. 1 <= n <= 105
2. nums.length == n + 1
3. 1 <= nums[i] <= n
4. All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
