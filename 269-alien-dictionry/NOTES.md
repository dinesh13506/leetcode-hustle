1. Kahn's Alforith to find topological sorting.
2. ["abc","ab"] , A string s is lexicographically smaller than a string t if at the first letter where they differ, the letter in s comes before the letter in t in the alien language. If the first min(s.length, t.length) letters are the same, then s is smaller if and only if s.length < t.length.

In case this case s > t but questions says words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. So return "" as it's not possible.
