1. Time Complexity

n = number of cities
e = connections

O(n) => to init representtative array and rank array

O(eloge) => to sort connections

O(e alpha(n)) => find/union till all edges in worst case

O(n) => to find connected components

Overall : O(eloge)


2. Space Complexity

O(n) => to store representtative array and rank array
