[270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)

Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the BST that is closest to the target.


```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
Output: 4
```

```
Input: root = [1], target = 4.428571
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
2. 0 <= Node.val <= 109
3. -109 <= target <= 109
