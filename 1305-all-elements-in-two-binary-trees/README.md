[1305. All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees
](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-elements-in-two-binary-search-trees/)


Given two binary search trees root1 and root2, return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in ascending order.


```
Input: root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3]
Output: [0,1,1,2,3,4]
```

```
Input: root1 = [1,null,8], root2 = [8,1]
Output: [1,1,8,8]
```

Constraints:

1. The number of nodes in each tree is in the range [0, 5000].
2. -105 <= Node.val <= 105
