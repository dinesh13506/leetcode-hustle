### 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees
[894. All Possible Full Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-possible-full-binary-trees/)

Given an integer n, return a list of all possible full binary trees with n nodes. Each node of each tree in the answer must have Node.val == 0.

Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree. You may return the final list of trees in any order.

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.


```
Input: n = 7
Output: [[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]]
```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: [[0,0,0]]
```

Constraints:

1. 1 <= n <= 20
