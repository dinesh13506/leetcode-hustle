### 1214. Two Sum BSTs
[1214. Two Sum BSTs
](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-bsts/)


Given the roots of two binary search trees, root1 and root2, return true if and only if there is a node in the first tree and a node in the second tree whose values sum up to a given integer target.



```
Input: root1 = [2,1,4], root2 = [1,0,3], target = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 2 and 3 sum up to 5.
```

```
Input: root1 = [0,-10,10], root2 = [5,1,7,0,2], target = 18
Output: false
```

Constraints:

1. The number of nodes in each tree is in the range [1, 5000].
2. -109 <= Node.val, target <= 109
