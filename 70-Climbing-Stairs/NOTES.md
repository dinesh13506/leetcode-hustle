1. Problem is asking about minimum/maximum/number of ways/longest possible/is it possible to reach!
2. Decision we take at ith step is going to affect the decisions in nearby future.
3. Top down approch is going to use recursion with hashmap to store result of already calculated subproblems.

Time Complexity; O(N)
Space Complexity; O(N)
