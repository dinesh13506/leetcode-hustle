1. if Representative of Subset containing v1  == Representative of Subset containing v2 then v1 and v2 are already connected by some path. And in tree there exists only one unique path between v1 and v2. Return false if 1 is true.

2. If after processing all edges the number of disjoint subsets are greater than 1 then return false.
A tree will all the verticies connected. All verticies should have single representative node.
